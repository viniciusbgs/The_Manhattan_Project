# The Manhattan Project - Real Estate Heatmap and Price Prediction Game

## Overview

This project is a web application built using Flask that visualizes the heatmap of the most expensive properties in Manhattan from 2003 to 2023. Additionally, the application includes a mini-game where users are shown an image of a property and must guess its price.

---

## Features

- **Heatmap Visualization**: Interactive heatmap showing the distribution of the most expensive properties in Manhattan over the years (2003-2023).
- **Price Guessing Game**: A fun mini-game where users are presented with an image of a property and must guess its price. The game includes multiple levels of difficulty.
- **Future Predictions**: Planned integration of a machine learning model to predict future property values based on historical data.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python used to build the web application.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries used for data visualization and creating the heatmap.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for data preprocessing and future machine learning model development.

Data Sources
------------

The data used in this project was obtained from the NYC government. The raw data was cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas to ensure it was suitable for visualization and analysis.

Future Work
-----------

-   **Machine Learning Model**: Develop a predictive model to forecast property prices in Manhattan for the next few years.

-   **Game Enhancements**: Add more levels to the price guessing game and introduce a scoring system to track user performance.
